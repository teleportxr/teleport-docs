The Teleport Protocol
#####################

The Teleport Protocol is a network protocol for client-server immersive applications.
Essentially this means that applications can be used remotely without downloading or installing them.
The protocol is open, meaning that anyone can use it, either by writing a client program or by developing a server that uses the protocol.

Teleport is a top-level application-layer protocol. It uses three transport layers in parallel: a WebSocket connection for signaling, a media/data transport (WebRTC by default, with optional SRT/EFP support) for real-time streams, and an HTTP(S) service for static asset retrieval.

Teleport XR Ltd provides reference implementations of both client and server.
The protocol and software should be considered pre-alpha, suitable for testing, evaluation and experimentation.

The protocol uses three concurrent connections between a client and server:

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Signaling              | A WebSocket connection (JSON, with optional binary         |
|                        | frames) used to discover the server, negotiate the         |
|                        | media/data transport, and exchange a small number of       |
|                        | out-of-band messages while streaming.                      |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Data Service           | The real-time transport. The reference implementation      |
|                        | uses WebRTC data channels; see :ref:`data_transfer`. It    |
|                        | carries six logical streams (video, video tags, audio,     |
|                        | geometry, reliable commands/messages, unreliable           |
|                        | messages).                                                 |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Static Data (HTTP)     | An HTTP or HTTPS service used to retrieve large assets     |
|                        | (textures, meshes, materials) by ``avs::uid``. See         |
|                        | :ref:`http_service`.                                       |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

The Signaling connection is established first; the Server then sends a
**Setup Command** which contains the parameters needed by the Client to
attach to the Data Service and the HTTP service.
