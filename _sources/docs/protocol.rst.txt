The Teleport Protocol
#####################

The Teleport Protocol is a network protocol for client-server immersive applications.
Essentially this means that applications can be used remotely without downloading or installing them.
The protocol is open, meaning that anyone can use it, either by writing a client program or by developing a server that uses the protocol.

Teleport is a top-level application-layer protocol. It uses three transport layers in parallel: a WebSocket connection for signaling, a media/data transport (WebRTC by default, with optional SRT/EFP support) for real-time streams, and an HTTP(S) service for static asset retrieval.

   * - TCP / UDP / TLS / DTLS-SRTP / SCTP
     - Standard transports underlying the above.

Teleport XR Ltd provides reference implementations of both client and server.
The protocol and software should be considered pre-alpha, suitable for testing, evaluation and experimentation.

Here is the code:

The protocol uses three concurrent connections between a client and server:

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Signaling              | A WebSocket connection (JSON, with optional binary         |
|                        | frames) used to discover the server, negotiate the         |
|                        | media/data transport, and exchange a small number of       |
|                        | out-of-band messages while streaming.                      |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Data Service           | The real-time transport. The reference implementation      |
|                        | uses WebRTC, with five SCTP data channels (video, video    |
|                        | tags, geometry, reliable commands/messages, unreliable     |
|                        | messages; see :ref:`data_transfer`) plus RTP media tracks  |
|                        | for audio (see :doc:`protocol/audio`).                     |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Static Data (HTTP)     | An HTTP or HTTPS service used to retrieve large assets     |
|                        | (textures, meshes, materials). See         |
|                        | :ref:`http_service`.                                       |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

The Signaling connection is established first; the Server then sends a
**Setup Command** which contains the parameters needed by the Client to
attach to the Data Service and the HTTP service.

The data source may be the same server, or it may be one or more other sources.
