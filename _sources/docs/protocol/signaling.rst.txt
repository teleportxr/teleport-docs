.. _signaling:

Signaling
=========

*Signaling* is the process whereby client and server exchange reliable messages for initial setup, as well as configuration changes and disconnection while the Teleport connection is active.

In the reference implementation, a single **WebSocket** connection per server is used for signaling. Any suitable bidirectional reliable transport may be used, but the message format below must be preserved.

Connection
----------

The server listens for WebSocket upgrade requests, typically on port 8080 (any port is acceptable as long as the client knows to try it). The reference client opens

.. code-block:: text

    ws://<host>:<port>/<path>

where ``<path>`` is taken from the ``teleport://`` URL the client was launched with. The path identifies the requested session on the server (it may be empty).

The full message exchange:

        S-->>C: acknowledgeHandshake (same transport as above)
        Note over C,S: ...streaming...
        C->>S: disconnect (text)


Signal types
------------

All signaling messages are JSON objects that contain a ``teleport-signal-type`` member identifying the message type. Unknown ``teleport-signal-type`` values that are not handled at the signaling layer (i.e. anything other than ``connect`` and ``disconnect``) are forwarded to the WebRTC stack as part of the SDP/ICE exchange.

``connect``
^^^^^^^^^^^

Sent by the client. A **Client** that wants to join (the **Connecting Client**) periodically sends a ``connect`` message until it receives a ``connect-response``.

  .. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "teleport-signal-type":"connect",
        "content":
        {
            "clientID": 0,
            "teleport": "0.9",
            "identity": "<opaque identity string>",
            "capabilities": { "example_capability": true }
        }
    }

``clientID`` is zero if the client has not yet connected to this server session, and may be a unique non-zero id if it is attempting to reconnect.

``teleport`` is the protocol version (currently ``"0.9"``).

``identity`` is an opaque string the client supplies for application-level authentication (may be empty).

``capabilities`` (optional) is a free-form object advertising optional protocol features supported by the client. Unknown keys MUST be ignored, so the set can grow without a version bump. No keys are currently defined; the member is the extension point for future signaling-level capabilities. Avatar support is **not** among them — see :ref:`signaling_avatars`.

Servers MUST ignore any unrecognised member of ``content``, so the message can be extended without breaking older implementations.

``connect-response``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sent by the server in response to ``connect``.

  .. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "teleport-signal-type":"connect-response",
        "content":
        {
            "clientID": 397357935703467,
            "serverID": 13503465235793
        }
    }

``clientID`` and ``serverID`` are unsigned 64-bit numbers. They are unique on the server: no two clients can have the same ID.
The ``serverID`` represents the session: if it matches a previous connection from the same client, cached resource and node ids may persist (but this must not be assumed);
otherwise the client must clear all resource and node ids for this server.

``ice-servers``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The server may send an ``ice-servers`` message after ``connect-response`` and before ``offer``, listing the STUN/TURN servers the client should use for ICE candidate gathering. This lets a deployment configure TURN once, on the server, rather than requiring every client to carry its own TURN credentials.

  .. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "teleport-signal-type": "ice-servers",
        "iceServers": [
            { "urls": "stun:stun.example.com:19302" },
            { "urls": "turn:turn.example.com:3478", "username": "user", "credential": "pass" }
        ]
    }

Each entry follows the standard WebRTC ``RTCIceServer`` shape: ``urls`` (a string or an array of strings), and optional ``username``/``credential`` for TURN entries. A client that does not receive this message, or receives an empty list, MUST fall back to its own default ICE server configuration.
If provided, a client **may** use the ``iceServers`` list for WebRTC connections it creates for this session.

``offer`` / ``answer``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After ``connect-response``, the server initiates the WebRTC `ICE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment>`_ exchange. The server sends an ``offer``:

  .. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "teleport-signal-type": "offer",
        "sdp": "[sdp contents]"
    }

where ``[sdp contents]`` is a `Session Description Protocol (SDP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol>`_ string describing the six data channels (see :doc:`data_transfer`).

The client replies with an ``answer``:

  .. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "teleport-signal-type":"answer",
        "id":"1",
        "sdp":"[sdp contents]"
    }

``candidate``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both sides also send one or more ICE candidates:

  .. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "teleport-signal-type":"candidate",
        "candidate":"[ICE candidate string]",
        "id":"1",
        "mid":"0",
        "mlineindex":0
    }

When each side has received the other's ``offer``/``answer`` and at least one viable ``candidate``, the WebRTC PeerConnection becomes ``connected`` and the data channels open.

.. _signaling_reliable_fallback:

Reliable-channel transport fallback (binary WebSocket frames)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The signaling WebSocket is **also** a transport for reliable-channel payloads. This is required because reliable-channel traffic — most importantly the ``SetupCommand`` and the client's binary ``Handshake`` reply — typically needs to be exchanged before the WebRTC PeerConnection has reached ``connected`` and the ``reliable`` data channel (label ``reliable``, id 100; see :doc:`data_transfer`) has reached ``open``.

Implementations therefore MUST support a dual reliable transport with the following rules.

Payload format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A reliable-channel payload sent on the signaling WebSocket is transmitted as a **single binary WebSocket frame** whose body is **byte-identical** to the payload that would be sent on the WebRTC ``reliable`` data channel. No additional framing, length prefix or envelope is added on either transport.
* Text frames on the signaling WebSocket carry only the JSON message types listed above; binary frames carry only reliable-channel payloads.

Sender rules (both directions)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A sender MUST be able to deliver any reliable-channel payload over either transport.
* A sender MUST prefer the WebRTC ``reliable`` data channel once it has reached the ``open`` state, and MUST use the signaling WebSocket otherwise.
* The choice of transport is per payload: the sender MAY switch transports for the next payload as soon as the preferred one becomes available.
* A sender MUST NOT send the same logical payload over both transports.

Receiver rules (both directions)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A receiver MUST accept reliable-channel payloads on both transports for the entire lifetime of the session, not only during early connection setup.
* A binary WebSocket frame and a message on the WebRTC ``reliable`` data channel MUST be dispatched through the **same** parser; the ``CommandPayloadType`` / ``ClientMessagePayloadType`` discriminator that begins every payload is sufficient to identify it.
* Ordering across the two transports is **not** guaranteed. Receivers MUST tolerate a reliable-channel payload arriving on the WebSocket after another payload sent later on the WebRTC ``reliable`` data channel (or vice-versa). Per-message ordering tools provided by the protocol (``ack_id``, ``confirmationNumber``) apply identically on both transports.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

The exchange around session start, with the WebRTC handshake still in flight when the server starts streaming setup:

.. mermaid::

    sequenceDiagram
        participant C as Client
        participant S as Server
        Note over C,S: signalling WebSocket open; WebRTC ICE in progress
        S-->>C: SetupCommand (binary WS frame)
        C-->>S: Handshake (binary WS frame)
        Note over C,S: WebRTC reliable channel reaches "open"
        S-->>C: AcknowledgeHandshake (reliable data channel)
        C-->>S: ReceivedResources (reliable data channel)

The exchange when the WebRTC handshake finished before the server sends setup:

.. mermaid::

    sequenceDiagram
        participant C as Client
        participant S as Server
        Note over C,S: WebRTC reliable channel already open
        S-->>C: SetupCommand (reliable data channel)
        C-->>S: Handshake (reliable data channel)
        S-->>C: AcknowledgeHandshake (reliable data channel)

.. _signaling_avatars:

Avatar negotiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the server supports user avatars it may send an ``avatar-policy`` at any time after ``connect-response``.
If avatars are not supported, the client may ignore the message and will not be asked to provide an avatar.
If avatars are supported, the client may respond with an ``avatar-offer`` message containing a URL for the
avatar it wants to use. If avatars are required, the client should send an ``avatar-offer`` even if it has no avatar to offer (``have_avatar == false``).
If avatars are required and the client has no avatar to offer, the server may terminate the connection or use a default avatar for the client.
The server will reply with an ``avatar-result`` indicating whether the offer was accepted or rejected.
Servers may later send ``avatar-revoke`` to invalidate an accepted avatar.

Every avatar message concerns the recipient's **own** avatar. No signaling message tells a client anything about another client's avatar.

The full protocol — wire fields, requirements bag, proof schemes, security and privacy model — is specified in ``plans/avatars_plan.md`` in the source tree.

  .. code-block:: JSON

    { "teleport-signal-type": "avatar-policy",
      "content": { "policy_id": 12345, "requirement": "optional",
                   "default_available": true,
                   "requirements": { "formats": ["glb"], "max_file_bytes": 8388608 },
                   "proof": { "required": false, "accepted_schemes": [] } } }

  .. code-block:: JSON

    { "teleport-signal-type": "avatar-offer",
      "content": { "policy_id": 12345, "have_avatar": true,
                   "url": "https://avatars.example.com/u/42.glb",
                   "content_hash": "sha256:abcd",
                   "declared": { "format": "glb", "file_bytes": 4096 },
                   "allow_relay": true } }

  .. code-block:: JSON

    { "teleport-signal-type": "avatar-result",
      "content": { "policy_id": 12345, "status": "accepted",
                   "node_uid": 999, "using_default": false, "delivery": "relay",
                   "reasons": [] } }

If an avatar policy is implemented, every client receives ``avatar-policy`` and is expected to answer it.

An accepted avatar reaches other clients as an ordinary node in the scene whose mesh resource is delivered as a :ref:`MeshPointer <geometry_payload>` chunk — a URL the receiving client fetches over HTTPS, exactly as for any other mesh. ``avatar-result.delivery`` tells the owner whose URL that pointer carries:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``delivery``
     - Meaning
   * - ``"relay"``
     - The default. The pointer carries the owner's own URL, so peers fetch the asset from the avatar host. The URL is therefore visible to every other client in the session; an owner that does not want this sets ``"allow_relay": false`` on its offer. A relayed URL must end in a recognised asset extension (``.glb``, ``.vrm``, ``.gltf``), since clients select a decoder by extension.
   * - ``"import"``
     - The server re-hosts the asset at a URL it controls and the pointer carries that. Peers never see the owner's URL.

The server chooses the mode, may choose differently for different peers, and may change it during the session without notifying anyone. A client that cannot fetch a pointer reports it with the ordinary ``ResourceLost`` message on the reliable client-to-server channel; the server then re-hosts for that client alone. There is no avatar-specific failure message.

``avatar-result.node_uid`` is the session uid of the avatar's root node in the server's scene. The owning client may use it to recognise its own avatar in geometry traffic — for example to hide it in a first-person view. It is ``0`` when the server accepted the avatar but created no node; treat a zero uid as "no node to track", not as an error.

``disconnect``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sent by the client to terminate the session cleanly:

  .. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "teleport-signal-type": "disconnect"
    }

On receipt the server tears down the WebRTC PeerConnection and removes per-client state. The signaling WebSocket may also be closed at the transport layer.

After connection
----------------

Once streaming is active, the signaling WebSocket is used for:

* further ICE ``candidate`` messages (network changes, NAT rebinding);
* renegotiation messages forwarded to the WebRTC stack;
* the client-to-server ``disconnect``;
* the reliable-channel transport fallback described in :ref:`signaling_reliable_fallback` — this remains available for the lifetime of the session, although in normal operation it falls silent once the WebRTC ``reliable`` data channel is open.

Geometry, video, per-frame input and pose traffic always flows over the WebRTC data channels in :doc:`data_transfer`, and audio always flows over the WebRTC media tracks in :doc:`audio`; only the ``reliable``-channel payloads have the dual-transport behaviour above.
